# K Means Clustering
> k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)

#### Notes:
- Not to be confused with K-nearest neighbors algorithm.
- Unsupervised
